# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using a webcam. The system can alert the driver if drowsiness is detected, potentially preventing accidents caused by fatigue.

## Installation

1. Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Ensure you have TensorFlow installed: `pip install tensorflow`

## Usage

1. Run the `drowsiness_detection.py` script.
2. The webcam will capture the driver's face and eyes.
3. The system will analyze the driver's eyes to detect drowsiness.
4. If drowsiness is detected, an alarm sound will be played to alert the driver.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- Pygame
